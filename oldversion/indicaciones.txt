You are allowed to keep some of the styling (background colors, fonts, etc.) for your site but are required to customize (personalize) at least one element of the site. Here are some example customizations:


Font,

Colors,

Video,

Hover effects, etc.

Ensure that the content (i.e. text contained within the Home, About and GitHub sections) is customized and reflects what you want to say about yourself.
